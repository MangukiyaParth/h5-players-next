You may contact us for information on the legitimization of other data transfers.</p><p><b>EU transfers.</b> An EU transfer EUcan in the first place be legitimized based on an adequacy decision of the European Commission, in which it is decided that the (part within the) third country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection.

This could mean that we may transfer your data: (i) with your explicit consent, (ii) if this is necessary for the performance of a contract that has been concluded with you or has been concluded in your interest, or (iii) if this is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Lastly, in exceptional cases we may also transfer your data if the data transfer is necessary for our compelling legitimate interests and is not overridden by your interests or rights and freedoms.</p><p>You can contact us if you want additional information via our contact details as stated at the bottom of this Privacy Statement.</p><p><b>Google Analytics Blockage</b> Blockage Please note that we do not use Google Analytics on any of our websites.
